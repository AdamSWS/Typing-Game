# Typing-Game

This was another school program that I made. Very fun to play. 

This is a Typing-Game with a dictionary lookup. Each time the user generates a set of commonly misspelled words to type, the program starts a clock, timing the user to see how fast they can finish the assignment. Depending on the time taken to spell the words and the accuracy of the spelling, the user will earn points. For misspelled words, the user will lose points.
